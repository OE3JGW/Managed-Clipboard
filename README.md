Mark the text/area/picture/etc. which you like to have as a template, copy it with strg+c and then right click\Managed Clipboard\[ Manage Templates ] which opens the options-page. 
Now, depending on the type of content you try to save as a template choose "Save from Clipboard as Plain Text"/"Save from Clipboard as HTML". 
Type in a name for the template in the prompt that opened and save it. 
Now the template is saved and can be used with right click\Managed Clipboard\YourTemplate to insert the template where your curser is placed.

On the Config page you also can Import/Export your templates as a json file named template.json. 

If you click on a template on the config page you can see a preview (does not work with every content, as some content relies on stuff that only the page has where it comes from).

Installation:
Unpack the zip somewhere. 
Go to chrome://extensions/ and enable DEV-Mode. Add the extension as an unpacked extension. 
Thats it :)
