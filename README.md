# Managed-Clipboard
Chrome-Plugin for creating templates from clipboard-data


Mark the text/area/picture/etc. which you like to have as a template, copy it with strg+c and then press mouse right click\Managed Clipboard\[ Manage Templates ] which opens the options-page. 
Now, depending on the type of content you try to save as a template choose "Save from Clipboard as Plain Text"/"Save from Clipboard as HTML". 
Type in a name for the template in the prompt that opened and save it. 
Now the template is saved and can be used with Mouse-Right-Click\Managed Clipboard\YourTemplate to insert the template where your curser is placed.

On the Config page you also can Import/Export your templates as a json file named template.json. 

If you click on a template on the config page you can see a preview (does not work with every content, as some content relies on stuff that only the page has where it comes from).
